      <description>While in SDS 348, one of the first things we learned in Python was that Python is very flexible with string operations. The string operations allow for funny reconfiguring of letters in words, which can be see below:
first = &amp;quot;leo&amp;quot; last = &amp;quot;bobi&amp;quot; first + last ## &amp;#39;leobobi&amp;#39; last[:3]+first[2:]+&amp;#39; &amp;#39;+first[:3]+last[2:] ## &amp;#39;bobo leobi&amp;#39; 2*first[0:1] + 2*last[-1:] ## &amp;#39;llii&amp;#39; 2*(first[0:3]+last[-3:]) ## &amp;#39;leoobileoobi&amp;#39; We also learned that the strings created in Python are immutable!</description>

0. Introduction The datasets, regseasonstats and postseasonstats1 are both National Basketball Association player game statistics during the 2018-2019 basketball season. Players included in each of the datasets played 70% or more of their teams games and played at least 5 playoff games. The regseasonstats2 data observes the top 51 players from the regular season that made playoff appearances ranked by ESPN, and the postseasonstats2 data observes those that met the same 70% or more of all games played and also participated in at least 5 postseason games.</description>

Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., donâ€™t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
